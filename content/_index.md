        My current research is all affiliated with SOUTH (the Student Operated Undergraduate Tokamak with rf Heating), where I designed the plasma diagnostics systems architecture. This was a unique challenge due to an extremely tight budget, but I found these restrictions encourages some creativity, and greatly enjoyed the chance to work on a fully clean sheet project.

        As a spin-off project, my undergraduate thesis work is on the use of a 2D array of Hall effect sensors to directly image the toroidal field of SOUTH. This device is anticipated to be a great help in the R&D and commissioning stages, and it will significantly de-risk the project.
        
        If you work for a University, National Lab or Fusion company and are interested in collaborating on making SOUTH happen, please either email me directly or [reach out to project through our website](atomcraft.com.au).
