## AtomCraft and the SOUTH Tokamak: Looking for Collaborators!

'AtomCraft' is an undergraduate student-led initiative to design, build and commission a tokamak at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The device is a small, spherical tokamak featuring conventional magnets and relying on electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), influence primarily by the Danish NORTH tokamak (which is Tokamak Energy’s ex-ST40). The device has been dubbed SOUTH: Student Operated Undergraduate Tokamak with rf Heating. Unlike most Tokamaks, SOUTH’s focus is primarily pedagogical. The AtomCraft project seeks to train the next generation of fusion-ready multidisciplinary engineers and physicists by engaging students in complex and impactful fusion engineering research from as early as their second undergraduate year.

As a student project, AtomCraft operates on an extremely tight budget, with an extremely low tolerance for risk (to ensure student safety and project viability), and the need to fundraise operating costs from philanthropic institutions and the fusion industry. This funding requirement makes producing easily communicable and exciting results a priority. The project also suffers from a tyranny of distance associated with Australia’s geographical isolation from the fusion industry, which restricts access to expertise and potential collaborators.
