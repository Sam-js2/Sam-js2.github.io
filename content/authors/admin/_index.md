## About Me

I am a late-stage undergraduate student studying Physics, Chemistry and Aerospace Engineering at the University of New South Wales, and a Gates Cambridge scholar-elect for 2025. My research is focused on the development of instrumentation for nuclear and high-energy applications. I started this work at the SOUTH tokmak at UNSW, and will continue it working on the LHCb collaboration during my PhD starting in Michaelmas 2025. Outside of my academics, I am an avid runner with a history of employment in the public service.
